# Exploring digital heritage

## Description
This unit will examine how digital tools and techniques can be used to extend our understanding of cultural heritage theory and practice. From the now familiar world of blogs and social media, through to big data and computer vision, technology is changing the way we work within cultural heritage. Students will investigate these new methods of research and representation, analysing their implications and experimenting with data, text, and images. Through practical exercises using a range of digital tools, students will gain skills, confidence, and critical insights into the future of cultural heritage practice. 

## Learning outcomes

On completion of this unit, students will be able to:

1. categorise and compare a range of digital tools and techniques, relating them to needs and opportunities within the cultural heritage sector;
2. analyse the political, social, and ethical implications of the use of digital technologies within cultural heritage research and practice;
3. employ a variety of digital tools and techniques to analyse, enrich, and visualise cultural heritage data;
4. and use digital tools to engage audiences with cultural heritage collections and projects.

## Timetable

| Week  | Topic | Activity |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1  | **Digital survival skills**: Introduction to the unit. Overview of digital tools and techniques. | Getting comfortable with consoles and command lines |
| 2 | **Doing it in public**: Digital history/humanities has a strong commitment to openness and public engagement. Are public history and digital history the same thing? Are there limits on openness?  | Setting up a blog. Using social media. |
| 3 | **Collections and contexts**: How have digital collections changed the practice of history? What do digital collections show and what do they hide? | Exercises in understanding search and the algorithms that shape our online experience. |
| 4  | **Big data / small data**: As more and more cultural heritage content becomes available online how do we grapple with the challenges and opportunities of digital abundance? What do we lose or gain as we shift scales between big data and small stories? | Getting and cleaning data: using CSVs, OpenRefine and APIs |
| 5  | **Analysing texts**: What happens when we treat texts as data? What sorts of patterns can we reveal and extract? How might these techniques enrich collection descriptions? | Using Voyant / QueryPic etc. From word clouds to NER. |
| 6  | **Seeing differently**: What new possibilities emerge for analysis and representation when we have cultural heritage data in a digital form?  | Extract features, make charts, network diagrams. |
| 7  | **Adventures in time and space**: What assumptions are built into the way we build maps and timelines? How might we use digital tools to extend our understanding of the way historical experience can be represented within time and space? | Geolocation, making maps |
| 8  | *Non-teaching*  |  |
| 9  | **Seeing like a computer**: Computer vision technology is developing rapidly offering exciting opportunities for analysing large pictorial collections, while raising important concerns about privacy and freedom. What are the possibilities and the dangers? | Facial recognition APIs / NNs |
| 10  | **VR, AR and games**: 3D representations of museum objects can now be created with your phone and used to populate immersive VR environments. What sort of experiences can we create and what do they mean? | Create 3D representation using 123D catch, upload to SketchFab |
| 11  | **Archiving the web**: How will future historians use and understand the huge volume of cultural content shared through the web? What are web archives and how do you use them?  | Use wget/twarc to archive digital content |
| 12  | **Online interventions**: How can digital tools be used to make political interventions? Rapid response collecting can preserve the experiences and perspectives of people caught up in current events. Bots can be deployed to undermine the language of corporate or political authority. | Fun with userscripts |
