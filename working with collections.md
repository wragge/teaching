#Working with collections

## Description

This unit is an introduction to cultural heritage collections and the techniques used to describe, manage, use, and explore them. Collections document our lives, memories, and culture. Creating and maintaining collections is a core activity of most galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Students will identify key issues affecting the development of collections, and explore how digital technologies can be used to improve public access and engagement. Through a series of practical examples, students will review systems and standards used in the documentation and display of collections, and gain experience in the use of digital tools to capture and enrich collection data.

## Unit learning outcomes

On completion of this unit, students will be able to: 

1. discuss the social, political, technological, and institutional contexts within which collections are created and described;
2. explain the technical requirements for describing and managing collections;
3. recognise how digital tools can be used to describe and enrich collections; 
4. and identify opportunities for enhancing the discovery and use of collections.

## Timetable

| Week  | Topic | Activity |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1  | **Collections and collectors**: Unit introduction. What do you collect and why? On the internet is everyone a curator? | Create a Trove list / exhibition |
| 2 | **Collections and communities**: Overview of the different types of cultural heritage collections and collecting organisations -- from national institutions to community groups. What are their similarities and differences?  | Constructing a taxonomy of collections. |
| 3 | **Policies and assessments**: From collection policies to significance assessments -- who collects what and why? | Start setting up Omeka. |
| 4  | **Descriptions**: How and why do we describe cultural heritage collections? How are descriptive systems shaped by political and social forces? | Description exercise. |
| 5  | **Metadata standards**: What is the role of standards in promoting best practice and interoperability? Which standards are relevant in which circumstances?  |  |
| 6  | **Contexts and connections**: No object exists in isolation -- how do we understand and represent the web of relationships connecting resources, people, events and places. What does provenance mean, and how does this meaning change across different types of collections? | Mapping relationships -- intro to Linked Open Data. |
| 7  | **Systems and workflows**: How are descriptions captured within systems for the management and discovery of collections? What types of management systems are there and what are their differences? | More on Omeka -- modules and exhibitions. |
| 8  | *Non-teaching* |  |
| 9  | **Discovery**: What is the relationship between description and discovery? How do people find and use collections? | Geolocation -- creating simple maps |
| 10  | **Digitisation**: What do you need to think about when embarking on a collection digitisation project?  | Hands on digitisation exercise |
| 11  | **Enrichment**: How can collection metadata be improved and enriched? How can we use digital tools to improve discoverability of collections? | Crowdsourcing exercise |
| 12  | **Interfaces**: How do we use collections online? What alternatives are there to the familiar search box? |  |
