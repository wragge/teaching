##Unit description

### old (2014)

The unit is an introduction to collection management. Museum collections, large or small, require techniques of control, recording and maintenance. These techniques are required from the moment an object is identified for acquisition, along the chain of possession into the collection, allowing for valuation, storage and access (for example, exhibition, loans, community and research access). The role of collection management in association with departments, such as conservation and exhibitions, is also included. A case study approach is used.

### new

This unit is an introduction to the rich variety of cultural heritage collections and the techniques used to describe, manage, use, and explore them. The unit will examine both the social and technological contexts within which collections are created and described. Systems and standards used in the documentation of collections will be critically assessed through a series of practical examples. Digital technologies bring new challenges in the management of digitised and born digital resources, but also offer exciting new opportunities for enrichment and discovery. This unit will provide a solid grounding in current collection practices, as well as an understanding of these expanding possibilities.

## Learning outcomes

On completion of this unit, students will be able to: 

### old

1. understand the key issues associated with collection management systems;
2. research and generate ideas for exhibition development.

### new

1. understand the technical requirements of describing and managing collections;
2. appreciate the social, political, and institutional contexts within which collections are created and described;
3. use online tools to create, describe, and enrich collections; 
4. and identify opportunities for enhancing discovery and use of collections.

## Timetable

| Week  | Topic | Activity |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1  | **Collections and collectors**: Unit introduction. What do you collect and why? On the internet is everyone a curator? | Create a Trove list / exhibition |
| 2 | **Collections and communities**: Overview of the different types of cultural heritage collections and collecting organisations -- from national institutions to community groups. What are their similarities and differences?  | Constructing a taxonomy of collections. |
| 3 | **Policies and assessments**: From collection policies to significance assessments -- who collects what and why? | Start setting up Omeka. |
| 4  | **Descriptions**: How and why do we describe cultural heritage collections? How are descriptive systems shaped by political and social forces? | Description exercise. |
| 5  | **Metadata standards**: What is the role of standards in promoting best practice and interoperability? Which standards are relevant in which circumstances?  |  |
| 6  | **Contexts and connections**: No object exists in isolation -- how do we understand and represent the web of relationships connecting resources, people, events and places. What does provenance mean, and how does this meaning change across different types of collections? | Mapping relationships -- intro to Linked Open Data. |
| 7  | **Systems and workflows**: How are descriptions captured within systems for the management and discovery of collections? What types of management systems are there and what are their differences? | More on Omeka -- modules and exhibitions. |
| 8  | *Non-teaching* |  |
| 9  | **Discovery**: What is the relationship between description and discovery? How do people find and use collections? | Geolocation -- creating simple maps |
| 10  | **Digitisation**: What do you need to think about when embarking on a collection digitisation project?  | Hands on digitisation exercise |
| 11  | **Enrichment**: How can collection metadata be improved and enriched? How can we use digital tools to improve discoverability of collections? | Crowdsourcing exercise |
| 12  | **Interfaces**: How do we use collections online? What alternatives are there to the familiar search box? |  |
| 13  | Review |  |

## Assessment

1. Participation and presentation: Moodle reflections on weekly readings and activity. Presentation on the readings in assigned week.
2. Collection proposal: Proposal to a fictional collecting organisation to accession a new collection -- address collection policy, significance and ethical issues; describe appropriate descriptive framework and metadata standards; identify issues for ongoing management and use and possibilities for exhibitions.
3. Develop online collection
