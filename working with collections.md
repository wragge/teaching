##Unit description

### old

The unit is an introduction to collection management. Museum collections, large or small, require techniques of control, recording and maintenance. These techniques are required from the moment an object is identified for acquisition, along the chain of possession into the collection, allowing for valuation, storage and access (for example, exhibition, loans, community and research access). The role of collection management in association with departments, such as conservation and exhibitions, is also included. A case study approach is used.

### new

This unit is an introduction to the rich variety of cultural heritage collections and the techniques used to describe, manage, use, and explore them. The unit will examine both the social and technological contexts within which collections are created and described. Systems and standards used in the documentation of collections will be critically assessed through a series of practical examples. Digital technologies bring new challenges in the management of digitised and born digital resources, but also offer exciting new opportunities for enrichment and discovery. This unit will provide a solid grounding in current collection practices, as well as an understanding of these expanding possibilities.

## Learning outcomes

On completion of this unit, students will be able to: 

1. understand the key issues associated with collection management systems;
2. research and generate ideas for exhibition development.
